# charLSTM-RNN
CharLSTM-RNN is a simple plug-and-play script that uses LSTM-based recurrent neural networks to generate text character-by-character.
Simply link your source text and go. 

CharLSTM-RNN is built on top of Theano, a parallel computing framework that will run on most GPU's.

CharLSTM-RNN was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's char-rnn (https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).
